            <h1>Honda City</h1>
            <p>Honda has pushed the launch of the 2020 City due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country. So, while we will have to wait to get our hands on the new sedan, a brochure has been leaked revealing more details about the fifth-gen sedan. 

                The safety features on offer are six airbags, ABS with EBD, a three-point seatbelt for rear centre passenger, vehicle stability control, hill launch assist, and tyre pressure monitoring system. However, most of these features are expected to be limited to the top-spec ZX variant only. The standard safety net is likely to include dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors, and ISOFIX child seat anchors. 
                It also features a sunroof, an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (outgoing model gets a 7-inch unit), as well as LED headlamps and tail lamps. While earlier it was assumed that Honda would offer a fully digital instrument cluster with the 2020 City, the brochure reveals the sedan will get a semi-digital instrument cluster featuring a 7-inch display with a g-meter (a device to calculate the magnitude and direction of acceleration) and an analogue speedometer. 
                Like the outgoing model, the new City will be offered with a set of 1.5-litre petrol and diesel engines. Where the petrol engine will make 121PS (2PS more), the diesel will continue to produce 100PS as before. This time around, Honda is expected to offer the diesel engine with CVT option as well along with a 6-speed MT. The petrol City, on the other hand, is likely to get a 6-speed MT instead of a 5-speed unit along with an optional CVT.
